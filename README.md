# NHL-xG-Model

This repo details my process and result of building an expected goal (xG) model for the NHL. The v1.0 model used data scraped from the NHL API before it moved to the new address.

## In progress:
With the NHL API moving to a new address, I took the opportunity to make some slight improvements to the model in some game states like penalty shots. Otherwise, this model was built off the same process and data.
